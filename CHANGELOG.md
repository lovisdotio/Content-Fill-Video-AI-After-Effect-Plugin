## Development Notes

### Why These Limitations?
- **480p**: Current fal.ai wan-vace model limitation
- **24fps**: Model training constraint
- **81 frames**: Processing time and cost optimization
- **Save warning**: Plugin modifies composition during rendering

### Future Plans
- Higher resolutions when fal.ai supports them
- Variable frame rate support
- Longer video processing
- Multiple AI model options
